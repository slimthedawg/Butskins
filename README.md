# Butskins

Welcome to this Butskins repository!

*Note - This is my first real repository and so my first free public software release!



This file is ment to give an introduction to my program "Butskins" which easily enough is a trading tool for Bitskins using their API as well as Steam API. The program will not trade any skins, only show skins and generate the link for any particular item, both for bitskins and steam. This is mainly a low-leveled sequrity feature as well as a protection from doing bad trading. Furthermore, it provides the used with vital information about any particular skin inside the bitskins servers, with respective comparisons to their steam information.

This program is free of use and Donations are warmly welcomed at my newly created patreon account :)

*Important - All images can not be uploaded to the Github since they only take in 100 at a time and there is 4663 weapon images in total              so either download them all from images/weapons from the Google Drive or download everything from the drive since it takes              waaay too long to upload everyone.


Q/A

Q: Why upload now?
A: I recently stopped trading with bitskins since their 15% fee and I basically stopped trading at all (still got some passive investments) and figured I might give some back to the csgo community :)

Q: Is it free?
A: Yes

Q: Will you take request for changes?
A: Probably not, it's been a while since I did this project and I got other things to do(again why I give it away).


Hope you get good use for it like I did!
